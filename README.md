# Module_12_challenge
This application analyzing various techniques to train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes. It also helps get the count of the target classes, train a logistic regression classifier, calculate the balanced accuracy score, generate a confusion matrix, and generate a classification report.

## Technologies

- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) - Pandas is included in Anaconda distribution and Conda package manager to manage Python environments.
- [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/) - web-based user interface designed for data analysis. It lets you write, run, and review the results in Python programs (all in a single integrated development environment (IDE).
- [The imbalanced-learn documentation](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable) - mbalanced-learn (imported as imblearn) is an open source, MIT-licensed library relying on scikit-learn (imported as sklearn) and provides tools when dealing with classification with imbalanced classes.
 - [The scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable) - Simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis.
