# Supervised Learning - Logistic-Regression-Model-Credit-Risk-Analysis-Report

This application analyzing various techniques to train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes. It also helps get the count of the target classes, train a logistic regression classifier, calculate the balanced accuracy score, generate a confusion matrix, and generate a classification report.

## Technologies

- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) - Pandas is included in Anaconda distribution and Conda package manager to manage Python environments.
- [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/) - web-based user interface designed for data analysis. It lets you write, run, and review the results in Python programs (all in a single integrated development environment (IDE).
- [The imbalanced-learn documentation](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable) - mbalanced-learn (imported as imblearn) is an open source, MIT-licensed library relying on scikit-learn (imported as sklearn) and provides tools when dealing with classification with imbalanced classes.
 - [The scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable) - Simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis.

## Installation Guide

Install imbalance-learn
Open a terminal window, and then activate your dev virtual environment by running the following command:
```
conda activate dev
```
Install imbalance-learn by running the following command:
```
conda install -c conda-forge imbalanced-learn
```
Verify the installation by running the following command:
```
conda list imbalanced-learn
```
Note that the result on your screen should resemble the following image:

Install PyDotPlus

If your dev virtual environment is still active, skip to Step 2. Otherwise, activate your dev virtual environment by running the following command:
```
conda activate dev
```
Install PyDotPlus by running the following command:
```
conda install -c conda-forge pydotplus
```
Verify the installation by running the following command:
```
conda list pydotplus
```
Note that the result on your screen should resemble the following image:

Summarize the results from the machine learning models. Compare the two versions of the dataset predictions. Include your recommendation, if any, for the model to use the original vs. the resampled data. If you donâ€™t recommend either model, justify your reasoning.

The model that used the resampled data was more accurate at predicting the creditworthiness of borrowers.
